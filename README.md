# Database-Testing-SQL

This project focuses on database testing using MySQL. It encompasses the setup of a MySQL database, the creation of tables, the insertion of data, and the execution of SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data.

## Prerequisites

To replicate the project setup, you will need the following software and tools:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
  
## Getting Started

1. Download and install XAMPP.
2. Start the XAMPP control panel and ensure that the MySQL service is running.

## Instructions

1. Open MySQL client.
2. Create a new database named `database_assignment`.
3. Execute the SQL queries from the `database_assignment.sql` file to create the `customers` table, insert data, and perform various data retrieval operations.

## Usage

The SQL queries in the `database_assignment.sql` file cover the following tasks:

- Creating a database and a table.
- Inserting customer data into the table.
- Retrieving data based on specific criteria.
- Modifying the table structure (changing column names).

## Queries

The `database_assignment.sql` file includes detailed SQL queries for each task, making it easy to follow and reproduce the testing procedures.

## Membership Categories

The project also includes a SQL query that categorizes customers based on their points, defining them as Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum members.
